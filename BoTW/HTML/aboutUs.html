  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class = "aboutText">Band on the Wall has been a cornerstone of Manchester’s thriving music and cultural landscape for the greater part of a century.
  Our mission is to promote equality and diversity through music and to bring leading artists from around the world to the stage –
  both at our award-winning Manchester venue and nationally, through touring programmes and trailblazing creative music projects.
  Our unusual name harks back to the building’s days as The George and Dragon pub in the early 20th Century. Regulars would affectionately
  refer to the ‘Band on the Wall’ as the place where house musicians quite literally played on a stage halfway up the back wall to make room in the busy pub.
  It’s more than seven years since we re-opened in 2009 following major refurbishment. Since then we’ve gone from strength to strength,
  delivering a multiple award-winning live programme supported by a unique learning and participation offer that has allowed us to engage
  with young people, emerging musicians, and the wider community.  We want to build on our success and create a unique facility with more
  dedicated space for learning and participation activity, along with an increased venue capacity that will enable us to bring more globally-renowned
  artists to Band on the Wall. We’ve provisionally raised £2m, but to realise our ambition, we need to raise a further £500k.</p><br>
  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p class = "aboutText">In partnership with Brighter Sound and the Manchester College, Band on the Wall delivers projects, classes and courses
    designed to nurture talent and promote hands-on learning in music.  Our in-house creative music programme includes a range of inspiring, dynamic and
    challenging opportunities for non-formal, hands-on learning. We offer a wide range of musical activities for all ages and tastes that are suitable
    for all participants regardless of age, experience or ability. These courses are delivered by Brighter Sound.  For those wanting a more formal
    learning experience, our accredited courses, delivered by the Manchester College, offer a unique opportunity to develop your skills and gain the
    qualifications needed to help kickstart a career in the music industry. Courses include Jazz Performance, Music Technology, DJ Technology and more –
    there is something for everyone.</p>
