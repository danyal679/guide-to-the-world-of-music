    <p>The Street Band is a nine piece band, playing dance music from the Americas, the Caribbean and Africa.The Street Band was formed about 10 years ago in Oswestry, Shropshire with the idea of performing at carnivals and street parades as a marching band. It comprised a loose collection of local musicians from a range of backgrounds, including salsa and jazz. As the band evolved it started establishing a repertoire of Caribbean, Latin and African music, chosen for its appeal for dancing. It largely settled its current personnel about 5 or 6 years ago and has been steadily developing and gathering a local fan base since then. The lineup features a four man horn section, supported by a sousaphone bass and a team of percussionists, 2 of whom also double on accordion and guitar. The current repertoire includes pieces from the ska, calypso, Congolese soukous, New Orleans, and South African township traditions, as well as a variety of Cuban and Latin pieces in son, cumbia, mambo, and conga styles. The pieces are chosen for dancing, and the band aims to create a fun atmosphere for people to party to. They have played in a variety of settings including the Dragon Theatre in Barmouth, Newtownâ€™s Crash Festival, Llangollen Fringe Accoustica, as well as at a number of smaller local events and private functions.
