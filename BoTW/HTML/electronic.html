  <p>Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments, digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology.
    An electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between
    sound produced using electromechanical means, such as violins and drums, and that produced using electronic technology.
    Electromechanical instruments include mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers, and so on, and electric elements, such
    as magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the
    telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar, which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences
    to hear with an instrument amplifier and speaker cabinet. Purely electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings,
    hammers, or other sound-producing mechanisms. Electronic instrument sounds can be achieved using devices such as the theremin,
    sound synthesizer, and computer.</p>
